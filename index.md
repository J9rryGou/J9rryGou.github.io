<!-- ## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/linmengsysu/linmengsysu.github.com/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/linmengsysu/linmengsysu.github.com/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

# About
I'm currently a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering/) at [the Tandon School of Engineering of New York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu/). My advisor is Prof. [Torsten Suel](https://engineering.nyu.edu/~suel/). Prior that, I graduated from [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm) (Zhongshan University) in 2019 and completed my Master Program Majored in Computer Science and Engineering at NYU Tandon in 2021. 

My primary research interests include **Information Retrieval** and **Web Search Engine Techniques**.

You can reach me by [jg6226@nyu.edu](mailto:jg6226@nyu.edu). Please feel free to contact me for any discussion or collaboration.
